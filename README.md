Hackman: A Hybrid AI Hangman Solver
This repository contains the solution for the "Hackman" AI challenge, a project to build an intelligent agent that excels at the game of Hangman. The agent uses a hybrid approach, combining a probabilistic n-gram oracle with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to make strategic, context-aware guesses.

The entire project, from data processing to training and evaluation, is contained in the Hackathon_Hangman_AI.ipynb notebook.
